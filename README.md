# Excel-Retail-Sales-Dashboard-Project
This project contains an Excel-based retail sales dashboard project that analyzes sales data across various dimensions, including orders, products, sales teams, store locations, and geographic regions. The workbook includes raw data sheets and summarized dashboards for revenue trends, product performance, category breakdowns, sales team contributions, and state-level insights. It's designed for data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence in a retail context.
